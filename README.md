# Czech-Financial-Data

This is a personal project with the aim that to SQL to extract relevant information and find meaningful result out of the data.

The data that I used is from https://data.world/lpetrocelli/czech-financial-dataset-real-anonymized-transactions.

Because that original files are in csv format, I had to create tables and create foreign keys and primary keys prior to my querries into the data.
